# sqlalchemy-challenge
In this challenge, I analyzed the climate of Honolulu to help plan my next vacation. I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries to access data from the hawaii.sqlite database. I performed some basic analysis on this climate data, and created charts to visualize precipitation and temperature trends over the last 12 months (this work is found in the "climate_starter.ipynb" file within the "surfsup" folder). From here, I created a climate app using a Flask API. The app had 6 available routes. The first, "/", started at the homepage and listed all the available routes. "/api/v1.0/precipitation" returns a JSON list of precipitation data with date as the key. "/api/v1.0/stations" returns a JSON list of stations in the dataset. "/api/v1.0/tobs" returns a JSON list of temperature data for the most-active weather station over the previous 12 months of data. "/api/v1.0/<start>" and "/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>" returns the minimum, average, and maximum temperature observed over a range of dates, or after a designated start date. The app can be found in the "app.py" file within the "surfsup" folder.
